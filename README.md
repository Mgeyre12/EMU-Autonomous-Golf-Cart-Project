### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps project-specific dependencies separate from other projects, helping avoid version conflicts.

1. **Open a Terminal**:
   - On Windows, open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - On Mac, open Terminal.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   py -m venv venv

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

4. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project-folder

4. **Install Existing Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Install New Packages as Needed (Example: Pandas)**:
   ```bash
   pip install <package-name>

5. **Update requirements.txt with the Latest Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment When Finished**:
   ```bash
   deactivate
